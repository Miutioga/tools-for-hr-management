## Introduction
Here are the tools to help with human resources management that you can download and use on **Google Colab**.

## Convert name and student code to mail (FPT Mail)
* Here, you will enter the link to your Google Sheet spreadsheet and the name of the worksheet (where the data to be transferred is located). Afterward, the tool will help you add an email column (the column you want it be).

*Note: You have to log in account to access to your Google Sheet or you can edit code to use your CSV file*.

* Enter the indices of the 'vắng' columns. In this example, 'Warning members' are those absent in quarters 3 and 4. Here, you can add more conditions or 'absent' instead of 'vắng' or any other column-condition's name you prefer, depending on your choice. It will output a dataframe consisting of warning members.
